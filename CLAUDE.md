## Known Bugs

- Fixed by `3d1bedfc`: binary float subtraction of decimal TSV scores could count
  an exact 0.100 SSIM2 loss as greater than 0.1. Calibration analysis now subtracts
  decimal values before float conversion, with a boundary regression test.
- Quality-dependent routing risk measurements and limitations live in
  `benchmarks/routing_harm_curve_2026-11-04.md`. No routing policy guarantees
  never-worse perceptual quality.
